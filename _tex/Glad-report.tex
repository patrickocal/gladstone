\paragraph{Outline} Australia is one of only three countries in the world with
a fully integrated supply chain for producing Aluminium
(\cite{GN-Aluminium-smelters}). In particular, Bauxite from Weipa, North
Queensland, is refined and smelted in Gladstone, Central Queensland.  Aluminium
smelting is a highly energy intensive process with Boyne Smelter Limited (BSL)
in Gladstone consuming approximately one-sixth of the total electricity supply
of Queensland.  Like other regions that produce aluminium, Central Queensland
is energy-abundant. It has an active coal-mining and natural gas industry. The
smelter is supported by a coal-fired power station. Its main purpose is to
supply power in the event of an extended blackout that would otherwise cause
costly damages to the smelter.

In this paper, we study the economic impact of closing down Boyne Smelter
Limited (BSL) on the Gladstone region over time. The key local variables of
interest are output, gross value added and employment. We model the broader
gladstone region and estimate the impact on the broader supply chain via
imports and exports. We present results for the standard 19 ANZSIC divisions
and for the economy on aggregate.


\paragraph{Summary of results}The sectors where there turns out to be an impact
of substance are Agriculture, Mining, Manufacturing and Utilities. These are
ANZSIC divisions A, B, C and D respectively. Our presentation and analysis of
results focuses on these sectors.  In brief, manufacturing and utilities are
both permanently worse off relative to the no-closure status quo.  In contrast,
mining and, to a lesser extent, agriculture are permanently better off with
investment and employment in these sectors increasing immediately after the
shock. Relative to status quo, when labour is mobile, the positive response by
mining and agriculture reduces the immediate shock to aggregate output to just
under 1.5\% and the economy has fully caught up within 10 years.  Relative to
status quo, when labour is immobile, the immediate shock to aggregate output is
just under 6\%, and the economy is still 1\% smaller 35 years later. The truth
is likely to lie somewhere in between. Still, relative to status quo, the impact
on consumption is small but positive for the same reason that mining and
agriculture respond positively: the price of utility goods (such as electricity
and water) permanently fall by 10\% as a result of the closure.

\paragraph{Background to the shock} Prior to the closure of the smelter, we
assume that all sectors of the economy grow at a rate of 1.5\% to 1.8\% and
that their growth path is balanced. Thus the stock variable capital grows at
approximately the same rate as flow variables such as output.  This assumption
is justified by virtue of the fact that BSL is forty years old, and much of the
local aluminium industry was established in the sixties and seventies.  The
main exception is Gladstone's second alumina refinery, Yarwun Alumina Refinery
(YAR), which opened in 2004.

\paragraph{Current capital.} Direct estimates of current capital per sector are
unavailable at the regional level. To do so, we exploit the intertemporal
features of our model to evolve the economy optimally and endogenously over a
long period of time (approximately 70 years).  This approach ensures that, at
the time of the shock, the distribution of capital across sectors, at the time
of the shock, is independent of the initial distribution of capital.  Indeed,
current capital depends only on the parameters of the model with our estimates
of productivity factors and investment flows playing a key role. 

\subsection*{Estimating the parameters} Our first source of data for estimating
the share parameters of the model are the 2019 ABS input-output
tables (5 and 8) for the Australian economy. Table 8 provides a full account of
the individual flows from sector to sector and from sector to household and
government.  For example, the flow of goods (such as bauxite) from the mining
sector to the manufacturing sector is a combination of local and imported goods
and an estimate of the total value of this flow can be found on table 8.  An
estimate of the domestic share of this composite flow can be found on table 5
and imports are found by taking the difference between table 8 and table 5.
For the present study, we aggregate the above tables from 114 IOIG industries
to the 19 ANSIC divisions (A, B, C, ..., S). 

The second source of data is the 1997 US “Make” and Capital/investment Flows
tables from the Bureau of Economic Analysis in the US. This is a commonly used
table that also features in the influential paper \cite{Atalay}.
We were able to adapt this to the 2019 Australian economy on the basis of
investment (Gross Fixed Capital Formation) data from the Australian
input-output tables and the GFCF by Industry by Asset type tables, also from
the ABS. With minor modifications, the traditional RAS method/algorithm works
well to ensure row column balance for this table in isolation.

We regionalise the above tables using a combination of 2016 census data and
Remplan so as to bring the economy as close as possible to the current
Gladstone economy.\footnote{We will replace this data in due course with data
from latest census and local industry data from BLADE.} Regionalising national
account data in a top-down manner is inherently imprecise and difficult. To
ensure robustness of our results, we created three different versions of the
Gladstone economy using two different methods which we now describe.
Regardless of method, the main results all point in the same direction. Our
reasons for preferring the second method are that the resulting collection of
tables not only look more reasonable, they also perform better with the
model.

The first method is the traditional RAS technique where (given estimates of
sectoral output, employment imports and exports for a region) one estimates the
individual flows between sectors by minimising the \emph{relative} entropy
subject to row-column balance (a form of regional accounting).\footnote{
  Relative to the Australian input-output tables mentioned above.  }

%This method often yielded tables that
%were clearly unusable for the model and the process of trying to fix the
%associated problems is very time consuming and still has no guarantee of
%accuracy for measuring the relative importance of different transactions.

The second method is more targeted. It involves the assumption of constant
returns to scale and, whilst keeping the Australian economy broadly intact,
using accurate data on specific flows between sectors, households and exports,
we make specific modifications to the table. In contrast with the first method,
no attempt is made to ensure the table is balanced. 
%
%We argue that this second method is more appropriate for a number of reasons:
%
%\begin{enumerate}
%    
%  \item it allows us to ensure that key transactions are well-modelled without
%  excessive distorting the rest of the table: something that is typical of the
%  RAS method;
%
%  \item we have an initial ``burn-in'' phase of 70 periods where the economy
%  evolves to account for the modifications that we have made.  In future work,
%  we will allow parameters to evolve during this phase.
%
%  \item the RAS method is intended to replicate a form of re-equilibration
%  process and this is what our burn-in phase achieves.
%
%  \item although a canonical CGE model can replicate the national accounts
%  data as an equilibrium for a given year, it cannot do so at the regional
%  level because the data is not available. 
%
%\item on a technical point, it is really only the relative importance that
%matters for estimating share parameters
%
%  \item The resulting collection of tables work extremely well with the
%  computational model.
%
%\end{enumerate}
%
Instead, we focus on ensuring that key transactions are in proportion to what
we observe in available data. In particular, we obtain precise estimates for
the cost structure of the Aluminium sector and scale up key transactions for
electricity supply in accordance with data on output from the Rio Tinto annual
accounts (\cite{RT}), electricity prices (\cite{AEMO}), export and import data
from Gladstone port (\cite{port}, and well-known estimates of cost from sources
on aluminium production such as \cite{GN-Aluminium-smelters} and \cite{bat}.
We then run the ``burn-in phase" for a variety of parameters and choose those
that yield an economy that best matches the regional data we have.  Our main
concern with the second method is the risk that the tables we have generated
paint a more diverse picture of the Gladstone economy than is in fact the case.
That is to say, there is the possibility that some other sectors are more
reliant on the smelter than our results suggest. We propose to deal with this
concern by conducting systematic robustness checks for a wider variety of
parameters.

\paragraph{The parameters in detail} A sample of the productivity parameters
that we calibrate through the burn-in phase are the following:

\begin{table}[H]
\centering
  \caption{\label{tab-prod} Productivity parameters per sector}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l}

  Divisions &  A  & B  & C  & D  & E  & \dots  & I  & J  & K  & L & \dots \\

\hline

  No shock & 31.2 & 31.7 & 32.6 & 21.9 & 31.6 & \dots & 31.4 & 31.1 & 21.8 &
  21.9 & \dots\\

\hline

  Shock & 31.2 & 31.7 & {\color{red}26.1} & 21.9 & 31.6 & \dots & 31.4 & 31.1 &
  21.8 & 21.9 & \dots\\

\end{tabular}
\end{table}
 
Initially productivity parameters were simply set using standard approaches
such as formulas for the minimum unit cost. Since this did not produce
reasonable output values in the long run, we adjusted these values to reflect
the higher output in sectors where output is higher.  These modifications are
relatively small on the whole.  The only exceptions were to divisions D
(Utilities), K (Finance) and L (Real Estate). These were set at 70\% of the
levels that were assigned using standard methods such as the minimum cost of
producing a unit adjusted by regional output per sector.  The reason for this
is that otherwise these sectors become excessively large during the burn-in
phase. Division L is where the exceptional IOIG sector ``Ownership of
Dwellings" is allocated. Ownership of dwellings constitutes 30\% of all gross
fixed capital formation as per ABS data. Arguably this is relatively
unproductive capital given that it is essentially housing.


In table \ref{tab-prod} we see that the shock entails a 20\% fall in the
productivity of manufacturing (C). This, on the one hand, is necessary because
otherwise the endogenous optimal investment process will simply return capital
to its previous state as if the smelter had never closed. On the other, we
argue that such a fall in productivity is reasonable given that the Aluminium
sector is so well vertically-integrated.  It can also be viewed as capturing
perception of higher risk of investing in Gladstone manufacturing after the
closure of the smelter.

To specialise the Australian table to Gladstone, the key transactions for which
we adjust parameters are the following (all specialisation ratios are relative to
Australia):

\begin{enumerate}
  \item exports of Manufacturing are three times domestic usage.
\item the specialisation ratio for Mining purchases by manufacturing is 2.
\item the specialisation ratio for Manufacturing purchases by manufacturing is
  1.5.
\item the specialisation ratio for Utility (electricity and water) purchases by
  Manufacturing is 7.
\item the specialisation ratio for imported Mining goods (such as bauxite) is
  5.
\item finally, we include the subsidy as a payment to capital.
\end{enumerate}

According to our calculations, the subsidy to aluminium amounts to
\$174\textsc{m}.


\paragraph{Subsidies} to aluminium smelting have been well-debated in Australia
for over 20 years \cite{subsidies}. In 2015, the Government-Owned Corporation
CS Energy  described its contractual obligation to GPS as onerous \cite[page
10]{CSE}.

In our calculations, we assume that BSL pays around $\$55$
per \textsc{mwh}. This is significantly lower than the Queensland wholesale
prices of around \$80 in 2019. Assuming that BSL would pay wholesale prices in
the absence of a subsidy, we estimate that the subsidy per \textsc{mwh} to
aluminium production at BSL is $\$25 $.  Using the fact that $14\textsc{mwh}$
are required to produce a single tonne of aluminium, and BSL produces
$499 \textsc{kt}$, given this data, we are able to obtain a precise estimate of
the subsidy to aluminium production at BSL, approximately
\[\$ 174.65\textsc{m} = \$25 \cdot 14 \cdot 499\textsc{k} \]

   \caption*{\footnotesize 
   CSE sells GPS's Electricity output at wholesale prices (\$80) and sells the
   base load quantity of approximately $7,000\textsc{gwh}$ per annum back to
   BSL (indirectly via GPS) at prices net of subsidy (\$55). This has lead it
   to publicly describe its contract with GPS as onerous (\cite{CSE}).}
  \end{figure} 


\paragraph{Summary of status quo economy} The final values for flows between
sectors are intended to capture the key features of figure \ref{fig-heatAcomp}
a table that we constructed for a previous report for QTC. Figure
\ref{fig-heatAcomp} presents data of the same type as table 8: composite flows
of domestic and imported goods.  For the present study, we need to pair this
data with estimates of a richer set of parameters which we derive from table 5
and US capital flows.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{The shock}
Aside from the
{\color{red} 20\%} shock to productivity and the {\color{red}25\%} reduction in
manufacturing capital, the scenarios involve modifying status quo transactions
as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    
  \item exports of Manufacturing goods decrease by {\color{red}25\%}
    
  \item purchases of Mining goods by Manufacturing decrease by {\color{red}
    10\%}

  \item purchases of Manufacturing goods by the Manufacturing sector decrease
    by {\color{red} 60\%}. This may seem high, but it is in line with the fact
    that, in Gladstone, most goods are manufactured for export.

  \item purchases of Utility goods by the Manufacturing sector decrease by
    {\color{red}85\%}. This significant part of the shock is in line with the
    fact that the smelter consumes one sixth of Queensland's electricity
    output.
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{More detailed analysis of results}

\paragraph{Overview} Under the assumption that the Gladstone economy remains on
a balanced growth path of 1.5\% to 1.8\% across all sectors, the main takeaway
is that only Manufacturing and Utilities are significantly affected in a
negative way. In fact, Mining and Agriculture benefit from the lower prices for
Utilities and Manufacturing goods as well as an improvement in their relative
productivity (relative to Manufacturing). On aggregate, although output, Gross
Value Added, employment and exports all fall, consumption is weakly, yet
positively (between 0\% and 1\%) improved as a result of lower prices.

\begin{figure}[H]

  \end{figure} 
%\begin{table}[H]
%  \begin{tabular}

%  \end{tabular}
%\end{table}

In practice, the 10\% fall in Utilities price may be tempered by the fact that
Gladstone is connected to the National Electricity Market and so the benefit of
lower demand for electricity from the smelter would be spread over a much
larger region and population. Indeed for the same reason, the impact on prices
is likely to be smaller. This will temper the gains to aggregate consumption.
The same holds for the gains to the Mining and Agricultural sectors.

\subsection*{Future work} 

\paragraph{Robustness checks}To ensure our conclusions are robust, we intend to run
a wider variety of shocks for a variety of parameterisations.

\paragraph{Other closures} Smelter closures in the recent past (Kurri-Kurri,
NSW in particular) have taken 5 years to decommission and begin the process of
repurposing the facility for a gas-fired power station that is to open in 2022:
a ten-year closure.  In due course, we will look at future policy actions such
as putting the smelter capital such as land to different uses. It could for
instance become a hydrogen processing plant or some other green-energy
facility. This could lead to a structural change and an increase in the
productivity of Manufacturing.  The model would be well-suited to studying this
and with an emphasis on the cost of delaying such a policy.
